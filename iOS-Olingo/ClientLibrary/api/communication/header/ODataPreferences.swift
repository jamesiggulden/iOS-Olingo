  ///
  /// Services that support odata.callback SHOULD support notifying the client through HTTP. Services can advertise
  /// callback support using the Capabilities.CallbackSupport annotation term defined in [OData-VocCap].
  ///
  /// If the service applies the odata.callback preference it MUST include the odata.callback preference in the
  /// Preference-Applied response header.
  ///
  /// When the odata.callback preference is applied to asynchronous requests, the OData service invokes the callback
  /// endpoint once it has finished processing the request. The status monitor resource, returned in the Location header
  /// of the previously returned 202 Accepted response, can then be used to retrieve the results of the asynchronously
  /// executed request.
  ///
  /// When the odata.callback preference is specified on a GET request to a delta link and there are no changes
  /// available, the OData service returns a 202 Accepted response with a Location header specifying the delta link to be
  /// used to check for future updates. The OData service then invokes the specified callback endpoint once new changes
  /// become available.
  ///
  /// Combining respond-async, odata.callback and odata.track-changes preferences on a GET request to a delta-link might
  /// influence the response in a couple of ways.
  ///
  /// - If the service processes the request synchronously, and no updates are available, then the response is the same
  /// as if the respond-async hadnât been specified and results in a response as described above.
  /// - If the service processes the request asynchronously, then it responds with a 202 Accepted response specifying
  /// the URL to the status monitor resource as it would have with any other asynchronous request. Once the service has
  /// finished processing the asynchronous request to the delta link resource, if changes are available it invokes the
  /// specified callback endpoint. If no changes are available, the service SHOULD wait to notify the client until
  /// changes are available. Once notified, the client uses the status monitor resource from the Location header of the
  /// previously returned 202 Accepted response to retrieve the results. In case no updates were available after
  /// processing the initial request, the result will contain no updates and the client can use the delta-link contained
  /// in the result to retrieve the updates that have since become available.
  ///
  ///
  /// If the consumer specifies the same URL as callback endpoint in multiple requests, the service MAY collate them into
  /// a single notification once additional data is available for any of the requests. However, the consumer MUST be
  /// prepared to deal with receiving up to as many notifications as it requested.
