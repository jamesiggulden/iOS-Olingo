  /// Close the underlying message entity input stream (if available and open) as well as releases any other resources associated with the response.
  ///
  /// This operation is idempotent, i.e. it can be invoked multiple times with the same effect which also means that calling the close() method on an already closed message instance is legal and has no further effect.
  ///
  /// The close() method should be invoked on all instances that contain an un-consumed entity input stream to ensure the resources associated with the instance are properly cleaned-up and prevent potential memory leaks. This is typical for client-side scenarios where application layer code processes only the response headers and ignores the response entity.
